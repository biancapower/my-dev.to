Using the arrow keys to move around in vim works, but it isn't efficient. The best way to move up, down, left, or right in vim is to use the hjkl keys. It feels strange at first, but is absolutely worth it (see [Why?](#FIXME) below).

This diagram shows which keys will move the cursor in which direction:

```
     ^
     k
< h     l >
     j
     v
```

NOTE: You must be in NORMAL mode to use these keys.

Hints for remember which keys are for which direction:

`h` is on the left, and moves you left
`l` is on the right, and moves you right
`j` looks a bit bottom heavy... it'll pull you down
`k` stands up tall, it'll boost you up!

# Why?

In Day 1 we said "don't worry about best practice!", and for the purposes of getting started, I absolutely stand by that. When a toddler starts walking they don't worry about their posture or how the look, they just figure out enough to stay upright! The rest comes with time and practice.

From today though, best practice matters. You can #FIXME

Vim is a lot like playing a computer game. The keystrokes are about efficiency. In late 90s PC gaming, WASD were the keys used to move around rather than the arrows, because they freed up the right hand to use the mouse for looking around the game etc. WASD were the keys chosen for efficiency and ergonomics of the left hand - they're on the left side of they keyboard, grouped together in a logical pattern for their use whereby the left hand stays in one place and a minimal amount of movement is needed in order to hit the right key - making for better gameplay!
