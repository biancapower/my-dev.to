As a developer and educator who loves git and GitHub and uses them daily, I've had in the back of my mind for a while now that I should take a look at some of GitHub's competitors, such as GitLab. What better motivation to do just that than GitLab's #GitChallenge...

GitHub and GitLab are both feature-rich, but for the purposes of this comparison I'll be focussing on the GitHub features I use most, and assessing GitLab as an alternative for these. Namely:

- [Hosting public and private repos](#hosting)
- [Spinning up quick static sites](#static-sites)
- [GitHub Classrooms](#)
- [Editing code in the browser](#)
- [Visualising what's going on](#)
- [Pushing / Pulling code to and from my local environment](#)
- [Ability to do everything from the command line](#)
- [Following people / repos / topics](#)
- [Viewing my and others' repos on a mobile device](#)

Additionally, I am only interested in what's available under the free tier.

# Hosting public and private repos <a name="hosting"></a>

Both have unlimited private and public repos and unlimited contributors

# Spinning up quick static sites <a name="static-sites"></a>

## GitHub Pages

- HTML / CSS / JS
- Markdown + Jekyll

## GitLab Pages

# Editing code in the browser

Although I donâ€™t do it very often, sometimes the most convenient way to make a minor edit to some code or some documentation is via the browser.

## GitHub

## GitLab

# Additional Points

## GitHub

- Lots of my stuff on there already
- Lots of free extras with student developer pack

## GitLab

- Open Source
- Great UI
- Self-hosted option
